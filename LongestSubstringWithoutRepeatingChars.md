### ðŸ’¡ Approach

We use the **sliding window technique** and a **HashMap** to track the last seen index of characters.

- Move the window start forward when a duplicate is found
- At each step, update the max length of the current valid window

---

### âœ… Time Complexity: O(n)
Each character is visited at most twice.

### âœ… Space Complexity: O(min(n, m))
Where `m` is the size of the character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters).

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps.  
`k` is non-negative.

The rotation must be done **in-place**, i.e., without using extra space for another array.

### ðŸ§ª Examples

#### Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

**Explanation:**

Rotate 1 step â†’ [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
Rotate 2 steps â†’ [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
Rotate 3 steps â†’ [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]


#### Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]

### ðŸ’¡ Approach

We use the **array reversal technique**:

1. Reverse the entire array
2. Reverse the first `k` elements
3. Reverse the rest of the array

This effectively rotates the array in-place.

### âœ… Time Complexity: O(n)
Each element is swapped at most once.

### âœ… Space Complexity: O(1)
Only constant extra space used.

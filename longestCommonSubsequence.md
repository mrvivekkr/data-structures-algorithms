# Longest Common Subsequence

## üìå Problem Statement
Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their **longest common subsequence (LCS)**.  
If there is no common subsequence, return `0`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated by deleting some (or none) characters without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

## üîπ Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**
text1 = "abcde"
text2 = "ace"
**Output:**
3
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is `"ace"`.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**
text1 = "abc"
text2 = "abc"

**Output:**
3
**Explanation:** The LCS is `"abc"` itself.

### Example 3
**Input:**
text1 = "abc"
text2 = "def"

**Output:**


0

**Explanation:** No common subsequence.

## üí° Approach
We solve using **Dynamic Programming**:
- Define `dp[i][j]` = LCS length of `text1[0..i-1]` and `text2[0..j-1]`.
- Transition:
    - If `text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]` ‚Üí `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`
    - Else ‚Üí `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
- Answer is `dp[n1][n2]`.

A naive recursive solution exists but is inefficient for large strings.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n1 * n2)` where `n1` and `n2` are lengths of the two strings.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n1 * n2)` (can be optimized to `O(min(n1, n2))` with rolling arrays).

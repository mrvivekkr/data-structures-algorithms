---

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.  
(i.e., from left to right, level by level).

---

### ðŸ§ª Examples

#### Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

#### Example 2:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]

#### Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []

### ðŸ’¡ Approach

- Use a **queue** to perform a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** traversal.
- For each level:
    - Record the number of nodes (`levelSize`).
    - Process and collect values of those nodes.
    - Add their children to the queue for the next level.

---

### âœ… Time Complexity

- **O(n)** â€” where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

### âœ… Space Complexity

- **O(n)** â€” for the output list and the queue used in traversal.

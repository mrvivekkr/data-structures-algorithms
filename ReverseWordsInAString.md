### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Given an input string `s`, reverse the **order of the words**.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.  
Return a string of the words in reverse order, separated by a single space.

âœ… The output should:
- Have no leading or trailing spaces
- Replace multiple spaces between words with a single space

---

### ðŸ§ª Examples

#### Example 1:
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"


#### Example 2:
Input: s = " hello world "
Output: "world hello"


#### Example 3:
Input: s = "a good example"
Output: "example good a"

### ðŸ’¡ Approach

1. Use `trim()` to remove leading and trailing spaces
2. Use `split("\\s+")` to break the string into words, ignoring multiple spaces
3. Traverse the words from the end and append them to a `StringBuilder`

---

### âœ… Time Complexity: O(n)
Where `n` is the length of the string

### âœ… Space Complexity: O(n)
For storing the split words and building the result
